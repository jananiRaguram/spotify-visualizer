# Spotify Visualizer

This repository contains original and forked code from the [Web Playback SDK Guide](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/guide/). The purpose of this visualizer is a way to see the network connections between a user's top artists and tracks. See the how they are connected through genre, album or another factor. 


## Running the visualizer

Start both client and server with the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The React application will start on `http://localhost:3000`
